\section{Introduction}

Nowadays, more and more scenarios benifits from \emph{decentralization}, which
is the core of blockchain systems. For example, Bitcoin, the origin of
blockchain, has proven it's significance to digital assets, while Ethereum has
proven how important is decentralization to DApps. And there are more and more
blockchain projects explore how they can leverage decentralization.

Oberviously, the backbone of decentralization in blockchain is the openness and the
anonymous.
%These features in someway secures the trading and data on
%blockchain. Consequently, no one can change users' data or get the owner of some data
%without getting users' private key.


Yet, the openness and the anonymous obstruct the emergence of value
measurements~\cite{meiklejohn2013fistful}. There are two aspects. First, it is
difficult to infer if some accounts belong to the same user, which means it is
difficult to build a mechanism like HTTP Cookie~\cite{Cookie}, or using
traditional data analysis technologies to understand characteristics of users.
Second, the openness of blockchain makes it vulnerable to manipulation,
especially for value measurements. Attackers can easily get all details about the
value measurements, and figure out the weakness of the whole system. This
largely differs from traditional value measurements which are close or
independent.

We believe that the effective value measurement are the foundations of
blockchains' prosperity. Both the lack of value measurements and the
ineffectiveness value measurements may confine blockchains to limited
scenarios.

First of all, we need a methodology to quantify the value of the data,
applications and accounts on blockchains. The root cause is cooperations on
blockchain keeps scaling up, and the requirements of efficiency
keeps growing. Without value measurements, such cooperations may be affected or
out of control.

Second, blockchains are still at the very early stage, and the value of data
and assets on the blockchains are still underground and waiting to be found.
And effective value measurements will uncover the value and empower more
applications and enable more scenarios, for example, loans, credit, data
search, personalized recommendation and cross-chain interaction.

Third, incentive, which is based on value means, is necessary to healthy
ecosystems on blockchains. Without effective value measurements, incentive may
lead a blockchain system to corruption and collapse eventually.

As a conclusion, a effective value measurement for blockchain needs to be
\begin{itemize}
\item{truthful} the rank needs to measure some characteristic of a
blockchain system, and thus can be trusted in some way;
\item{justicial} this means the rank need to be manipulation resistant, and
it is the core of the rank algorithm;
\item{diversity} there will be different ranking requirements from different
applications on blockchain, thus a good rank algorithm should cover different
scenarios.
\end{itemize}

We believen Nebulas Rank shall be a effective value measurement for
blockchains.

For truthfulness, we define Nebulas Rank to be quantification of an account's
contribution to the blockchain systems after considering many different
metrics.

We believe that cryptocurrencies should have the attributes of money and
three functions of money: medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of
account since blockchains themselves are economic systems and the classical
monetary theory still has the instruction value.
Furthermore, we believe the value of cryptocurrencies come from the
liquidity. Specifically, each transaction between users increases the
liquidity of cryptocurrencies, and endows the value of
cryptocurrency eventually. Thus, the on-chain transactions are effective and
natural data sources for effective value measurements.

To evaluation the effectiveness of Nebulas Rank, we calculate the sum of all
accounts' Nebulas Rank on Ethereum, and compare it with the market capital
given by \texttt{coinmarketcap.com}. Our evaluation shows strong
coorelation between them, about $0.84$. That means Nebulas can measure
accounts' contribution at the micro-level, while it can measure the
value of blockchain systems at the macro-level.

For justice, we involve a special function to resist manipulation,
and our analysis demonstrate its performance on manipulation
resistant.

Based on the theory of Nebulas Rank, we divide Nebulas Rank into Core Nebulas
Rank and Extended Nebulas Rank for different applications and scenarios.

Core Nebulas Rank defines the algorithm to calculate an account's contribution
to the whole blockchain system in a certain period of time. And such
calculate involves two factors, the median stake of an account in a certain
period and the in-and-out degree of the account in a certain period.

Extended Nebulas Rank is for different applications and scenarios,
and it bases on Core Nebulas Rank. For example, we show how to rank smart
contracts based on Core Nebulas Rank. We also show how to extend Core
Nebulas Rank to a multi-dimension vector.

Beside theory and methodolog of Nebulas Rank, we also present our
consideration about how to implement Nebulas Rank, including wether
put ranking scores on-chain, how to update the algorithm of Nebulas Rank,
and our future work on Nebulas Rank.

  Special Hint:
  The content is this yellow paper may be different from the description in our
  whitepaper (version 1.02 released on April 2018)~\cite{Nabulas}. This is because we keep
  thinking and verifying the algorithm in our whitepaper. And now we are more
  confident and capable to make it more rigorous. We use a different format
  (like this paragraph) to emphize the difference in this yellow paper.
