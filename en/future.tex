\section{Future Work}
The goal of Nebulas Rank is to provide a necessary value measurement for blockchain, from the perspective of giving an evaluation on the contribution from user account addresses to aggregate economy. There will be more work along the way. Here we briefly summarized the future work we will be working on:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Cross-chain Nebulas Rank.} We can foresee there will be high demand on cross chain data transfer in the near future. To name a few examples, cross-chain data interaction and digital asset transfer will certainly need value measurement on different chains. For example, when developers transfer their Dapps from one chain to the other chain, a method for how to calculate the Nebulas Rank of the Dapps will also need an unique value measurement among different chains.
\item{More contribution indictors based on economy aggregate.} Nebulas Rank is based on the contribution to the economy aggregate. However, the development of the blockchain industry needs its community. Therefore, in terms of the economy aggregate, we cannot ignore the contribution of the community. So, how do we evaluate an individual’s or organization’s contribution in the community, and how this is reflected in Nebulas Rank, certainly has tremendous implications.


\end{itemize}
