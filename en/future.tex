\section{Future Work}
The goal of Nebulas Rank is to provide a necessary value measurement for blockchain, from the perspective of providing a fair evaluation based on the real contribution from user account addresses to aggregate economy. While a work in-progress, we summarise our future plans to be implemented in the near-future:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Cross-chain Nebulas Rank.} We can foresee there will be high demand for cross chain data transfer in the near future. To name a few use-cases, cross-chain data interaction and digital asset transfer will certainly need value measurement on different chains. For example, when developers transfer their Dapps from one chain to another, a method for how to calculate the Nebulas Rank of the Dapps will also need an unique value measurement among different chains.
\item{Further contribution indictors based on economy aggregate.} Nebulas Rank is based on the contribution to the economy aggregate. However, continued growth for blockchain mandates a growing community. Therefore, in terms of the economy aggregate, we cannot ignore the contribution of the community. So, how do we evaluate an individual’s or organization’s contribution in the community, and how this is reflected in Nebulas Rank, certainly has tremendous implications.


\end{itemize}
