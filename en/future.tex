\section{Future Work}
The goal of Nebulas Rank is to provide a necessary value measurement for block chain, but not just from the perspective of giving an evaluation on the contribution from user account address to economy aggregate, there will be more work along the way. Here we briefly summarized the future work we will be working on:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Cross-chain Nebulas Rank} We can foresee that there will be high demand on cross chain data transfer in the near future. To name a few examples, cross-chain data interaction and digital asset transfer will certainly needs value measurement on different chains. The developers transfer their DApps from one chain to the other chain, how to calculate the Nebulas Rank of the DApps will also need an unique value measurement among different chains.
\item{More contribution indictors based on economy aggregate} Nebulas Rank’s base is the contribution to the economy aggregate, however, the development of the block chain industry needs its community. For sure, in terms of economy aggregate, we cannot ignore the contribution of the community, so, how to evaluate an individual or organization’s contribution in the community, and reflects it in the Nebulas Rank, certainly has tremendous realistic meanings.

\end{itemize}
